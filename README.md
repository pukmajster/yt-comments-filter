# YouTube Comments Filter
This is a browser extenstion for filtering out certain YouTube comments based on user preferences.
Current only supported for Google Chrome, but I'll try to make it work for other browers like Firefox.

# How to install

## Chrome and Edge
1. Download the .zip file (using the big green button) and extract the contents somewhere where the folder won't bother you
2. Go to the chrome extensions page (url: chrome://extensions/)
3. Enable 'developer mode'
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extracted yt-comments-filter folder
5. Configure your filters by going into the extension options or by just clicking on the extension icon in the toolbar

# Example:
If you want to remove every comment that includes the word "potato", make a new line and simply just write potato.
